# GitHub Actions is configured by writing "workflows".
# Workflows  define sequences of commands written in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) and must be
# located under the directory `.github/workflows/` at the root of your repository.
# ::newline
# This example workflow prints "Hello world", followed by "Step 1...", "Step 2...", "Step 3...", and finally "Goodbye".

name: hello-world-example

# ::span-comment
# We must specify what events trigger the workflow to run.
# In this case we run it every time someone pushes to the repo.
on:
  push:
# ::end-span

jobs:
  # A `job` specifies a sequence of commands.
  # We named this job `say-hello`.
  say-hello:
    # `job`s can run on [different machines](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on).
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # `steps` is a list of commands to run.
